"""Allowlist of `tool_id` values accepted by the canonical simulations endpoint.

This registry mirrors the catalog declared in
``auraxis-app/features/tools/services/tools-catalog.ts`` (and its web mirror).
Drift between the three is detected by ``scripts/check_tools_registry_parity.py``
which is run in CI.

When a new tool ships, add it here in the same PR that lands it on the app/web
catalog. Removing a tool here is a contract break — coordinate the migration
of historical simulations before doing so.
