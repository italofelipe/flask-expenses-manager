"""Credit card bill cycle + utilization service.

Pure helpers for determining a credit card's open bill cycle (start, end, due
date, status) given the cardholder's configured closing/due days, and for
computing how much of the card's limit is currently committed in a cycle.

The bill cycle math is anchored to a `date` so callers can ask for past or
future cycles by passing a non-today anchor. This keeps the function pure and
testable.

Utilization aggregates expense transactions in the open cycle window, including
`pending`, `overdue`, and `paid`. `cancelled` and `postponed` are excluded.
